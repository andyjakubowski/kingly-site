We provide an integration of Kingly with Vue with the [`vue-state-driven`](https://github.com/brucou/vue-state-driven) library. At the moment, all documentation for the library is to be found in the directory (`README` file) -- documentation may be slightly outdated vs. recent changes. An example can be found in the tutorials. We are in the process of moving it to this global documentation site.
