## Target architecture
As mentioned in the [tutorials](../tutorials/model-with-machines.html), Kingly's preferred architecture is the following:

![kingly-favoured ui architecture](../../graphs/high%20level%20architecture%20ui%20implementation%20with%20kingly.jpg)

As such, using Kingly in a vanilla-JS implementation involves defining modules for the interfaced systems and command handlers, and interfaces of those modules with Kingly.

## Example
We already provided an example of such integration in the [password meter tutorial](../tutorials/password-meter-ui-implementation.html#Vanilla-js).  

Additionally, I am in the investigation phase for writing the [BoulderDash game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiEVfa1OK_o) in vanilla-JS, leveraging Kingly to handle game events.
