We provide an integration of Kingly with React with the [`react-state-driven`](https://github.com/brucou/react-state-driven) library. At the moment, all documentation for the library is to be found in the directory (`README` file). We are in the process of moving it to this global documentation site. Note that the latest versions (> 0.10) may have issues running in codesandboxes probably due a change in build runner... The published package however works fine out of this peculiar context.
