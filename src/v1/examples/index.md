This section is open to contribution. Its goal is to showcase example of use of Kingly for user interface modelization.

Ideally, when you add an example, you should have:
- a working demo (!)
- what that demo is demoing (stack, specific modelization technique, etc.)
- a section with a drawing of the graph corresponding to the state machine
- a link to a codeplayground so the reader can have a look at the code
